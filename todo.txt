+ power decrease on movement
+ tutorial
+ asteroids
+ maintain the old speed when magnetizing (add velocity, not override), same for ship
+ sounds:
	magnetize
	asteroid collide
	pick up powerup
	accelerate
	lose
	win
+ sound looping
+ no win condition
+ gui and tutorials are scrolled
+ handle asteroids, powerups and ship out of screen
+ pointer to target (black hole)
+ no gameplay :D

- ship flashing on power up
- asteroid particles on destroy
- improve power and hp indicators (or like damage animations)

- black hole attraction ?
- destroy asteroids by black hole

- intro/outro/achievement art

- mouse released outside window not noticed
- acceleration depends on fps ?

-- implement rotationSpeed (now instant)
-- object collision response
