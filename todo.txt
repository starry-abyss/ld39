+ power decrease on movement
+ asteroids

- mouse released outside window not noticed
- object collision response
- sound looping
- gui and tutorials are scrolled
- no win condition
- no gameplay :D

- sounds:
	magnetize
	asteroid collide
	pick up powerup
	accelerate
	lose
	win

- maintain the old speed when magnetizing (add velocity, not override), same for ship
- implement rotationSpeed (now instant)
- tutorial
